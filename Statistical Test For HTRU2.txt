Test #1: K-Means & Fuzzy C Means
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that K-Means is better than Fuzzy C Means

Test #2: K-Means & Gaussian Mixture Model
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that K-Means is better than Gaussian Mixture Model

Test #3: K-Means & Agglomerative Clustering
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that K-Means is better than Agglomerative Clustering

Test #4: K-Means & Spectral Clustering
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that K-Means is better than Spectral Clustering

Test #5: K-Means & DBSCAN
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that K-Means is better than DBSCAN

For conclusion, the best algorithm for the current data (according to the T-test) is K-Means
